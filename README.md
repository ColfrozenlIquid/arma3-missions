# Arma 3 Wasteland Missions

This is a collection of in mission mission ideas for the A3Wasteland mission https://github.com/A3Wasteland/ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis

This project was an attempt to create new missions according to the newly implemented in editor Tasks system. This should generate less performance intensive missions that would be randomly generated, more versatile and more interactive than the currently provided ones.

This would allow for potential integration of the new missions into the private and potentially the public main branch of A3Wasteland.

Most of the missions are currently unfinished, yet they offered excellent practice with SQF scripting.
